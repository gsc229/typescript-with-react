1. Error output will output lines from the compiled index.js in the dist folder. That's not what we are woking in.
2. We want to be able to see error output in the .tsx file in the src folder
3. To achieve this we use mapping. 
4. We can tell Webpack to autogenerate a map that maps the error in the index.js to the .tsx file it originated in.
    ex. index.js line 10 --> index.tsx: line 5
5. We can use Webpacks Devtool: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/
