Some third party packages you'll use when creating apps include type definitions. 

However when those packages do NOT include type defs you can try to install them by doing:

npm i -D @types/package-name

Examples:

### Apollo client includes types, so just: 
npm i -S apollo-client 
or
npm install apollo-client

then:
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client'
hover over ApolloClient and the type def will show up. Hold ctr + click to see the code

### React
npm install react

then: 
import React from 'react'

Theres no type defs after hovering over React.
Hover over 'react' and you see:

Could not find a declaration file for module 'react'. 'c:/Users/gsc22/OneDrive/Documents/Lambda/Tutorials/Using TypeScript with React - Udemy/simple-typescript/node_modules/react/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
  Try `npm i --save-dev @types/react` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'react';`ts(7016)

So....first method:
npm i --save-dev @types/react

then: 

Hovering React you get:
'React' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)
(alias) namespace React
import React


...The Second method: add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'react';
(see the src directory)
